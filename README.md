All the desire and calculations swirling in my heart
I hide behind my smile, a poker face with hints of wickedness
I’ll make your short human life blossom, like that! Swear on my tao,
So why don’t you be one of my lovely dolls? I’m ready
It’s not really fun, knowing all our choices
The toys, each one waiting for their futures
Anything you could ever want! Now come, one by one
The “good children” come first, take home whatever you please!
Please now, let you be in my sweet little things~
Welcome to Shangri-la, free from all your worries -
So don’t be like that, act stiff or say anything stubborn here,
For this is an endless fantasia.

How can I get what I want from around the world?
Like a child, my heartbeat sings, I just keep my desire
Thousands of years? A piece of cake, like ordinal breathing
I will transcend, desires in my timid heart
So don’t say idle things like “only one of two options”
Anything, I’ll have in my hands
I will not shoulder regret over any single thing!
I live in the present, just as a maiden does
“Now let me please, ask you a question -“
What? You want to be like me…? What a silly person you are!
Why don’t you start by being part of my collection?
Will that suit your fancy, this forbidden celebration?
Just be in fantasia, there’s nothing wrong with that!
Until we’re bored of the dreams that can be found here, of
The faith of anything but me, we will float on like clouds
Floating free over desert years

Ah, “I’ll be waiting for you, always,” such romantic words!!
They make me shiver, turn me on! I’ll have to let you be entranced by my charms!
I’ll make your short human life blossom, like that! Swear on my tao,
So why don’t you be one of my lovely dolls? You’re welcome!
It’s not really fun, knowing all our choices.
Let us live like gamblers!
Anything you could ever want! Now come, the
　children who won’t wait their turn, take home whatever you please!
Please now, let you be in my sweet little things~
Welcome to Shangri-la, filled with everything wonderful -
So don’t be like that, act stiff or say anything stubborn here,
Well, it’s not like you would be able to much longer anyway…
It’s not really fun, knowing all our choices
The toys, each one waiting for their futures
Anything you could ever want! Now come, the
Children who won’t wait their turn, take home whatever you please!
Please let you be in my sweet little things~
Cluthing your one-way ticket to Shangri-la, free from all your worries
Dive into your city of dreams!

Chances for me to have what I want are lying all over the place
I don’t want to see myself just looking, not taking, baby
How many things, how many regrets do humans pile on top of themselves?
So you can beg me for my hand of saving grace
I’m extending it to you right here and now – it’s so easy!
Ah, I want to sit here and watch the changing ways of the world
It’d be nice too if I could meet a changing me… Well I’m just kidding
Though at times I become a little nostalgic
Everything that I remember are things that I have taken for myself

How can I get what I want with you?
Temptation is taking, taking over
My heartbeat sings, I just keep my desire
Thousands of years? A piece of cake, like ordinal breathing
I will transcend, desires in my timid heart
Our fate awoke in a world only one of two options
Let me say forever, anything in my hands
I will not shoulder regret over any single thing!
I live in the present, just as a maiden does
“Now let me please, ask you a question -“
What? You want to be like me…? Well, I don’t blame you.
There’s always space for you in my collection, baby
This feels just like a royal celebration
Just be in fantasia, there’s nothing wrong with that!
Until we’re bored of the dreams that can be found here, of
The faith of anything but me, we will ride upon the winds
Just as we please – we can be in desert years
